        <p>Congatulations parin po!!</p></br>
        No matter the results, I’m still proud of you. Yung effort na binigay mo means so much more than just rankings. I know na disappointing and it hurts talaga, and I won’t tell you to just ‘move on’ kasi valid ang feelings mo. Pero please don’t blame yourself. This doesn’t mean na you’re less talented or hardworking. Your effort didn’t go to waste just because the results weren’t what you hoped for. You still learned, improved, and pushed yourself, kaya nagmature yung writing mo and naka RSPC diba? And that’s something to be proud of.<br><br>
        I’m really sorry kasi wala talaga ako may nasabi habang naga rant ka. Hindi dahil sa wala akong pake—meron talaga. My heart ached seeing you on the verge of tears, and I hated that I couldn’t do anything to take the pain away. Please know po na kahit silent po ako, im still here for you, and I always will be.</p>
